# Side-by-side support in PowerShell 7 and later

Description and rationale.

## Motivation

    As a scripter,
    I can choose and launch the version of PowerShell I need,
    so that I can use automation built/tested against for downlevel LTS versions of PowerShell while still being able to use the latest versions on the same system.

## User Experience

Example of user experience with example code/script.
Include example of input and output.

```powershell
Get-Example
```

```output
Hello World
```

## Specification

## Alternate Proposals and Considerations
